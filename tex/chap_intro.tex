This gives the reader a brief profile of the agency, company or organization for which you worked. Inform the reader about the type of business, number of employees, geographic location, etc. Tell about the identity and the image of the businessâ€”how does the business (agency/organization/company) position itself in the industry. Next, move from general information to the specifics about the division or department you worked in. Here you might include an organizational chart of your department. Limit this section to two or three pages.
