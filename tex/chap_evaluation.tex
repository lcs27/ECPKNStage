\chapter{Self-Evaluation}
Take a long, hard look at your experience and tell the good and the bad of it. Make constructive criticism of use/misuse of you as an intern. Perhaps you learned something about yourself. Tell the reader about it and make recommendations and suggestions about how you can use what you’ve learned about yourself. Be sure to bring some insight, analysis and reflective thinking to this section. Don’t generalize and offer superficial, glib observations. Be specific and detailed in describing your experience.
